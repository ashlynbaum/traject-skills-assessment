I've been using the term "a rising tide raises all boats" quite a bit lately, and it's raised READMORE some eyebrows from people that wouldn't expect to hear me spouting trickle-down rhetoric. So, I'll be clear; I'm not advocating trickle-down economics. The tide I'm talking about is one of skilled people, and it's washing into the estuary of New Zealand's tech ecosystem. My point is simple, that more skilled people working in tech in this country will benefit the sector overall in the long run, regardless of which company they come here to work for initially.

The crux of my hypothesis is an assumption which I wish to test; that kiwi tech companies are somewhat altruistic. 

The business model being developed in secret (actually totally not secret, it's all up on this blog) here at Creative HQ by the Traject team has a few different moving parts. Namely, migrants, Accredited Employers, and Immigration New Zealand. All of these  have to move at the same time if the model is to function. Getting them to move means convincing each of them that the others are going to move as well. Understandably, each of them has concerns about the motivations of the others. My vantage point at the centre of all of this lets me see the motivations fairly clearly. 

Migrants want our Skills Assessments in order to gain residency. Without it they simply cannot become NZ residents, or it's going to take them two years longer. So they're pretty keen, to put it lightly. 

Immigration New Zealand wants our Skills Assessment service because it helps fulfil their goal to reduce the skills shortage in tech. The icing on the cake is that we're not introducing new processes or major policy in order to do this. Win-win. 

The only question mark is over the heads of large Accredited Employers. We need them to run the Assessments in order to meet risk mitigation standards. The logic here is that by only drawing upon skilled Assessors from Accredited Employers, the Accredited status of the company is an indicator of the credible nature of their employees.
