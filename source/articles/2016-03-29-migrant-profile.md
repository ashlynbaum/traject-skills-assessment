Ultimately, Traject's goal of working with Immigration New Zealand (INZ) and the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) is to have the greatest impact on the future of New Zealand READMORE, particularly in the tech sector. I am very grateful to how supportive INZ and MBIE have been throughout this process.

There is a group of highly skilled people in the world that do not qualify for skilled migrant visas. These people want to move to New Zealand, the are contributing members of society, and can foster the knowledge-driven economy of New Zealand.

> This small group of talented people causes the greatest impact on New Zealand's Economy.

Typically, when a person applies for a Skilled Migrant Visa, they have to prove that they are skilled. If the migrant is working in a field on the skill shortage list, then they have to be able to show that they are qualified to be able to work in field. What if these individuals are self-taught or the technology is so young that there are no current qualifications for this field? Then, they can not gain residency to live in New Zealand.

The IT sector is disproportionately affected by the formal education requirement for skilled migration into the country.

>  These are the people that allow New Zealand to compete in a global tech market.

The difference we, Traject, want to make, is simple: we want to support New Zealand for being on the Edge of Innovation in being able to support highly skilled individuals. We want to help the tech sector grow and attract the brightest people in the world to make that happen.
