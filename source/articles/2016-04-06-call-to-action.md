Right now we are looking for highly skilled people in the IT sector who want to immigrate to New Zealand. READMORE If this sounds like you: [let us know](http://www.traject.nz/). We want skilled people without formal qualifications to get involved in Traject's pilot program.

## What we're doing
Traject is currently in the process of validating, and iterating on, a skills assessment service to qualify skilled individuals, in the IT sector, for the Skilled Migrant Category (SMC) visa. Currently, if you are trying to move to New Zealand (or you're already here on a non-residency visa), you have a job offer, but no tertiary education or provable 5 years of employment, you will not qualify for an SMC visa. We want to change that; we want to help skilled individuals get a visa and residency as quickly as possible. 

The New Zealand economy needs to move past the current bottleneck of skill shortage in the NZ tech sector. We are looking to talk to candidates that do not have the proper qualifications then have people from relevant New Zealand businesses to assess their skills in the field. The assessment will be in the form of a written submission, and live interview. If they are deemed skilled, then they will qualify them for an SMC visa. Our Skills Certification will function in lieu of a piece of paper from a University.

## The status quo
To assess if an individual qualifies to work in a field on the Long Term Skills Shortage List for IT, a blunt measurement tool is used: does the person have a tertiary qualification, or five years work experience. Neither of these two options addresses the person's skill-set and ability to work in the field. Our research has shown that the tech sector is disproportionately affected by this blunt proxy for a skills assessment. 

A [survey](https://www.absoluteit.co.nz/2016/03/experience-outsmarts-university-degree/) of IT companies in New Zealand found that 68% of companies prefer hands-on experience and industry training over a university degree. Assessing individuals based on their skills is currently how the industry hires talent, and this is how immigration should address talent in the tech sector as well. 

Immigration New Zealand is simply not equipped to assess skills in this way. That's why we're here. Please, if this sounds like something you or someone you know might benefit from, [hit the link](www.traject.nz/).
