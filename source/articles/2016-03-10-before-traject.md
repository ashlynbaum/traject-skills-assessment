Before Traject entered this world of existence, our team was referred to as Street Cred. Street Cred READMORE was comprised of the members: Ashlyn Baum, Connor Boyle, and Gabrielle Young. We've worked together on various projects and pitched to the [R9Accellerator](http://www.r9accelerator.co.nz/). We were accepted into the accelerator, at [CreativeHQ](http://creativehq.co.nz/), to tackle the opportunity of helping business hire the talent the need by improving the employer accreditation process.

The revUp was a hackathon where we explored the problem and pitched our team and our understanding of the problem before we applied to be a part of the Accelerator.

We met Steffan Christensen at the RevUp. Steffan works at Immigration New Zealand, he processes the accredited employer applications. He was at the RevUp as a domain expert, and after working with Steffan, we decided we wanted him to join our team. Steffan has a wealth of domain knowledge, and will help our team tackle and create a solution for our opportunity.

> Steffan was seconded to join team Street Cred in the R9Accelerator.

As a team the opportunity of being able to work in a startup accelerator with that is in partnership with the New Zealand Government seems like such a forward thinking experience. Immigration has been super helpful in providing us access to the domain experts that we need.

### Hardship Happens
In a startup environment things can change very quickly and team dynamics can often change. Tragedy struck fairly early on: team Street Cred lost a member of the team. Gabrielle had to withdraw from participating in the accelerator. Even though this was a difficult experience, Connor, Ashlyn, and Steffan were able to move forward and grow from the experience.

### The Team Continues with a Name Change
Street Cred went through a few name iterations before Traject was chosen.

The team dynamic is working well. Three of us have been communicating well with each other and been able to utilize individual strengths, to accomplish all of our goals. Great things are to come, keep your eye out for updates.
